Description

  Code to enable posting of entries to MT via mail messages.

Limits

  -Only works w/ MT -- though it may not be too hard to adopt it to handle
   some other blogs.

  -Only handles mail messages of a certain form -- in particular if a mail
   message does not contain an image, an entry will not be created.  Note
   that only JPEGs are handled currently.

  -Only supports posting for a single user.

  -Does not support specification of category.

  -If a 3rd party determines the email address associated w/ creating
   entries, the 3rd party can create entries too.  I.e. obscurity of
   an email address is the only protection from posting via mail by
   unintended 3rd parties.
